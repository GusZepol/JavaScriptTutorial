<h1>Comparing For and While</h1>

<p>If you have read the previous chapter, about the for loop, you will discover that a while loop is much the same as a for loop, with statement 1 and statement 3 omitted.

    The loop in this example uses a for loop to collect the car names from the cars array:</p>
    
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
    const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Saab", "Ford"];

    let i = 0;
    let text = "";
    for (;cars[i];) {
        text += cars[i] + "<br>";
        i++;
    }

    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;
</script>
    
</body>
</html>
